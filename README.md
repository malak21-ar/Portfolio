# Portfolio
This is my first portfolio, presenting my academic background and my technical skills in computer science.

I built this portfolio using the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve my understanding and mastery of these technologies.

This portfolio currently contains only my skills and education/training.
It does not include my projects yet.

Its goal is to share my profile with recruiters, collaborators, and anyone interested in my background.
